## Project overview

[Brief description of what this project does]

**Tech stack:** [e.g., React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL]

## Dev environment tips

- Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
- Run `pnpm dev` for development server (always use dev, not build)
- After adding new dependencies, restart the dev server
- Environment variables are in `.env.example` - copy to `.env.local`

## Code style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Components go in `src/components/`
- API routes go in `src/api/`

## Testing instructions

- Run `pnpm test` before committing
- Run `pnpm lint` to check code style
- Run `pnpm typecheck` for TypeScript validation
- All tests must pass before PR

## PR instructions

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- Include tests for new features
- Update documentation if behavior changes
- Keep PRs focused on single changes
