# My Global Preferences

> This file is read by Claude Code at the start of EVERY session.
> Put your personal preferences here - they apply to all projects.

## General Behavior

- Don't auto-commit changes unless I explicitly ask
- Don't create documentation files unless I explicitly ask
- Be concise - I prefer short, direct answers
- No emojis unless I request them
- When unsure, ask me rather than guessing

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all JavaScript projects
- Use 2-space indentation
- Prefer functional programming patterns where appropriate
- Always add proper error handling
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Tools & Package Managers

- Package manager: pnpm (fallback to npm if pnpm unavailable)
- Testing: Vitest or Jest
- Formatting: Prettier
- Linting: ESLint

## Process Preferences

- Show me the plan before making big changes
- Tell me file paths so I can navigate to them
- Commit in logical chunks, not everything at once
- Run tests after significant changes

## Project Context

- Read AGENTS.md files in folders for context
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Respect .editorconfig if present
